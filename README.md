# Cards
Card app in Go

Trying out the Go language, trying to get as most of the basic functions in, and tried to stay up with the naming conventions.
Except for when the json package needed the variables to be uppercase to read properly.

## Battle of the Beasts!
In a time before ages there were two giants colliding in two different parts of the world.
But one day they met and can't stand the others' greatness!

So the only solution for this is to get a deck of card each, shuffle them around and deal a hand of 7!
Calculate the value of the hand and se who, once and for all, is the number one.

Unless there is a tie then no one wins and both go home.
